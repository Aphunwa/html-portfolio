<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Chinecherem Angus, a passionate and self-driven web developer
  from Nigeria.<br> I'm currently focused on full-stack development, starting 
  with HTML, CSS and moving<br> into React. With a strong interest in building 
  useful, clean and responsive websites. I<br> dedicate time daily to improve 
  my coding skills and create mini projects that reflect my<br> growth. 
</p>

<p>Before diving into tech, I worked at a fuel station for several years, where
  I learnt the<br> value of discipline, consistency and hard work. I'm currently doing
  my NYSC while<br> learning web development.
</p>

<p>I love history, music and creative storytelling. My goal is to grow into a skilled<br>
  full-stack developer.
